"""Unrolls trajectories within a scene and check for some coarse expected final state.

These tests are meant to catch subtle numerical / physics stability regressions.  MuJoCo has many
complex algorithms that interact in surprising ways.  Some physics bugs only arise over long
horizons of hundreds or thousands of physics steps.  These tests ought to catch some of those
regressions.
